# AI Engineer Technical Challenge – The Revenue Leakage Agent  

### Duration  
1.5 hours (core demo)

---

## Context
This challenge simulates an AI “financial detective” that investigates **revenue leakage** and can **propose and apply fixes** in a sandbox.  
All data is provided in JSON — no parsing required.

---

## Key Concepts
| Term | Meaning | Example Use |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Credit Memo** | A negative invoice that reduces what the customer owes — used when overbilled or a pricing error occurred. | Overbilled €25 000 → $27 000 → issue credit memo for $2 000 USD |
| **Plan Amendment** | An update to the contract/billing plan (total, cadence, entitlements) when the agreement itself changes. | Upgrade plan from $90 000 → $100 000 or add “Premium Support” |
| **Make-Good Invoice** | A new invoice to recover missed or underbilled revenue. | Missing September billing → invoice $8 000 USD |

---

## Objective
Build a **stateful AI agent** that can engage in conversations, answer questions, and perform actions. The agent should:

1. **Investigate** anomalies between billing plans and invoices  
2. **Propose** corrective actions (make-good invoice, credit memo, or plan amendment)  
3. **Apply** those actions to a writable **sandbox** with human approval  
4. **Explain** what it did and why, citing evidence or calculations  
5. **Answer questions** about billing plans, invoices, and revenue leakage issues
6. **Maintain context** across the conversation to enable follow-up questions and iterative investigation

The agent should be **conversational and stateful**, not a fixed workflow or pipeline. It should be able to have natural dialogues with users, remember previous interactions, and adapt its approach based on the conversation flow.

### Example Conversation

Here's an example of how a user might interact with the agent:

```
User: Can you check if there are any revenue leakage issues with plan C-1001?

Agent: I'll investigate plan C-1001 for you. Let me load the plan details and check the invoices...
[Agent uses load_plan("C-1001") and query_invoices(...)]
I found a discrepancy! Plan C-1001 should bill $10,000 monthly, but I only see invoices for September and November. October is missing. This represents $10,000 in missed revenue.

User: What currency is that plan in?

Agent: Plan C-1001 is in USD. The expected monthly amount is $10,000 USD.

User: Can you create a make-good invoice for the missing October billing?

Agent: I'll propose a make-good invoice for $10,000 USD for the missing October 2024 billing period.
[Agent uses propose_make_good_invoice("C-1001", 10000, "Missing October 2024 billing")]
Proposal created. Would you like me to apply this to the sandbox?

User: Yes, apply it.

Agent: [Agent uses apply(...)] Make-good invoice has been applied to the sandbox. The invoice ID is INV-MG-001.

User: What about the other months? Are they correct?

Agent: Let me check the other invoices for this plan... September shows $10,000 USD which matches the plan. November also shows $10,000 USD. Both are correct. The only issue was the missing October invoice, which we've now addressed.
```

Notice how the agent:
- Maintains context about plan C-1001 throughout the conversation
- Answers follow-up questions that reference previous context ("What currency is that plan in?")
- Understands references to previous actions ("What about the other months?")
- Adapts its responses based on the conversation flow

## Data Overview (`/data/`)
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `billing_plans.json` | Expected billing plans (contracts) |
| `invoices.json` | Issued invoices / bills |
| `credit_memos.json` | Existing credit memos |
| `exchange_rates.json` | FX rates |
| `/sandbox/*.json` | Writable ledgers for applied actions |

---

## Available Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `load_plan(plan_id)` | Read plan details |
| `query_invoices(filters)` | Filter invoices by plan, customer, date |
| `fx_convert(amount, from_ccy, to_ccy, on_date)` | Currency conversion |
| `propose_make_good_invoice(plan_id, amount, reason)` | Draft new invoice |
| `propose_credit_memo(invoice_id, amount, reason)` | Draft credit memo |
| `propose_plan_amendment(plan_id, change_set)` | Draft billing plan update |
| `apply(action_draft)` | Write to `/sandbox` after confirmation |
| `rollback(action_id)` | Undo last applied action |

---

## UI Requirements
- **Chat interface only** (NextJS / React / Streamlit / ...)
- Users interact with the agent through natural conversation
- The agent can display findings, proposals, and request approval for actions within the chat
- Optional: reasoning trace & audit-log viewer (sandbox/audit_log.json)
